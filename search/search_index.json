Trust here could refer to many themes, including for example trust in software components, trust in produced scientific results, and trust within journalism and news platforms. 'Trust on the web' within the context of these themes means that the 'data to be trusted', whatever that might be, is exchanged through the web, and thus the notion of trust needs to be addressed within the realm of the web. Naturally, before thinking about how to achieve this wide-range goal itself, the needed tools to achieve it need to be investigated thoroughly. As formal proofs are the driving force and the essence of what the source of trust is desired to be, the sharing of formal proofs within the realm of the web needs to be addressed. This leads to starting the investigation with a first exploratory tool: w3proof-dispatch .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#introduction","text":"At the higher level, this project attempts to address the notion of providing trust on the web by exploiting formal proofs , in contrast to the usual scene where trust in a 'statement' is provided only through trusting the entity claiming that statement, usually by the public key infrastructure model or by the web of trust model.

These 'assets' are usually produced by theorem provers and proof assistants . To trust a statement 'on the web' means to 'assert'/'declare' this trust and transmit the 'assertion' through the web. So, as we are considering formal proofs to be the source of trust, what needs to be transmitted and exchanged as the embodiement of this trust are formal proofs themselves, and thus the 'assets' referring to them. As a result, it makes sense to start the exploration by experimenting with how these 'assets' can be presented, shared, and distributed through the web, regardless, for now, of how different and diverse their forms can be, and what problems will arise from this fact. This diversity is due to the existence of several producers of such 'assets' (theorem provers and proof assistants), which differ in both aspects of their implementation as well as the logical foundations they stand upon, which makes the process of normalizing the form of these 'assets' to exchange them in a distributed and transparent manner non-trivial. But again, this is not the first thing to address, as before worrying about wanting to plant various kinds of trees in a garden, maybe to make it colorful, one first needs to know how to plant a tree in the first place. Hence, the w3proof-dispatch tool is a first attempt to explore the potential possibilities. Entry Goal The main goal of this tool is to address the idea of sharing formal proofs as produced by the Abella proof assistant, and the idea of sharing 'assertions' of the validity of some 'asset', according to some specific producer. What is meant by this? Components Involved To make things simple at the beginning, only one producer of 'assets' (proof assistant) is considered for experimenting. This producer is the Abella proof assistant. The other component within this experiment is the IPFS / IPLD model.","title":"w3proof-dispatch"},{"location":"w3proof-dispatch/#w3proof-dispatch","text":"","title":"w3proof-dispatch"},{"location":"w3proof-dispatch/#motivation","text":"Basically, we can consider a formal proof to be some 'asset' that is considered an evidence for the validity of some statement.
