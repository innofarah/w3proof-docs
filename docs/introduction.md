# Introduction

At the higher level, this project attempts to address the notion of providing trust on the web by exploiting [formal proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20hardware,using%20formal%20methods%20of%20mathematics.), in contrast to the usual scene where trust in a 'statement' is provided only through trusting the entity claiming that statement, usually by the [public key infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure) model or by the [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) model.

Trust here could refer to many themes, including for example trust in software components, trust in produced scientific results, and trust within journalism and news platforms. 'Trust on the web' within the context of these themes means that the 'data to be trusted', whatever that might be, is exchanged through the web, and thus the notion of trust needs to be addressed within the realm of the web.


Naturally, before thinking about how to achieve this wide-range goal itself, the needed tools to achieve it need to be investigated thoroughly. As formal proofs are the driving force and the essence of what the source of trust is desired to be, the sharing of formal proofs within the realm of the web needs to be addressed. This leads to starting the investigation with a first exploratory tool: [w3proof-dispatch](./w3proof-dispatch.md).
